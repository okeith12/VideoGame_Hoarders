The Boss is Going to be coming out the wall like on Best Indie Game's "Top 10 BEST Rogue-lite (Rogue-like) Platformers of ALL TIME" @1:22 

4 Levels - Different Seasons--Snow Level where the snow particles slowly increase into a Blizzard and if you get caught in it, MC freezes and allow enemies to attack or lose health, debating on which one to happen!

4 Enemies/Traps - Flying Bee who shoot at you, Spike Turtles that spikes come and go randomly when you try to jump on it, Platform that shoots up or down. Zombie who comes at you. Plant that shoots Freeze or Fire balls
